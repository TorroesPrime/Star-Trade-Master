Price of Hubris v.01
Description: +++To: Lord GeneraL CasTus IaCTon+++
+++From: Keybor Tayne, PrImary LexoGraPher+++
+++subjeCT: ConTaCT hIsTory wITh aurum+++
as requested, I have compiled a chronological account of our attempts to establish
relations with the natives of the planet designated: aurum. The following shows a repeated
pattern of rejecting diplomats, supporting your assessment that military envoys may be
better received.
787.m41: First contact made by naval survey team. reception is neutral. Post-contact analysis
reveals extreme resource value of planet. aurum is made high priority for re-indoctrination.
789.m41: Larger contact envoy sent to aurum, including adeptus ministorum and adeptus
administratum representation. negotiations quickly deteriorate, although adepts confirm
Imperial cultural roots before being forced to leave planet.
791.m41: Captain Laurel mattheos of Imperial navy and squad of armed crewmen force contact.
Contingent is unexpectedly well-received. reach agreement to allow Imperial presence in
capital city: haistand.
798.m41: Captain mattheos killed in action, negotiations resumed by rogue Trader diaz Lan.
reach agreement to allow small military outpost for protection of growing non-combatant
population in haistand. Construction begins on “The aspirance.”
802.m41: rogue Trader diaz Lan repeats contact. negotiations fail to allow Imperial presence
to extend beyond haistand.
809.m41: rogue Trader diaz Lan re-opens negotiation on previous topic. attempts to win
support by participating in local combat games. departs planet in critical condition from
reptile bites.
816.m41: rogue Trader diaz Lan repeats contact. aurans rebuff Lan and refuse to honour
future negotiations with him on grounds he is “not a man.”
+++The emperor Protects+++
This world is critical to the Crusade. If these primitives
only respect strength, we will send them the Deathwatch.
One way or the other, Aurum will be brought into
compliance.

Rooms:
Command Deck
Sturdy glass panels
depicting stellar bodies alternate with ancient cogitators and sensorium reporters. Every luminator is held aloft by a lifelike statue, and the eye can travel no more than a few centimetres without encountering some surface inlaid with precious stone or metal. The command throne sits recessed in the rear wall with an arch of cherubs carved above it.
