## actions the player can perform:
### performing a characteristic test
A characteristic test is when a character is called on to perform an action where the chances of success or failure is based on a compartison of a roll and a selected characteristic. The selected characteristic is temporarially modified by a "difficulty value" and then that value is compared to a random number ranging between 1 and 99. The "difficulty value" can be possitive, represting a test that is easier then 'normal', or negative, representing a test that is harder then normal. If the modified value is greater  then, or equal to the random number, it is a "success". Other wise it is a failure.


#### Example #1: 
Zail is attempting to shoot a target that is very far away, making it a "hard" test, and so the "difficulty value" is -20. Because Zail is attempting to shoot something, the relevent characteristic to be tested against is Zail's ballistic skill which is a 31 normally. Because this test has a -20 difficulty valuem a successful test will only occure if the random number is 31 or less.  The Random number generated is 32, thus the effort is a failure and Zail's shot misses it's target.

#### Example #2:
Zail is being tortured and attempting to resist the effects of the effort, thus they need to test on their "Will power". The individual who is doing the torturing is rather innept at the effort, resorting to basic and obvious efforts meaning that the test to resist the torture is a fair routine one, meaning the test will have a "difficulty value" of +20. Zail as a Will Power of 39, but because of the difficulty value for this test it is treated as being 59. Thus the test will be a failure if the random number is 60 or greater. The random number generated is a 28 indicating a success and Zail is able to resist this round of torture.

### Determining the degree of success/failure:
There are times that it is needed to know how much an effort succeded or failed by. This is referred to has the "Degrees of Succes" or "Degree of failure". To determine this, take the difference in values between the random number that was generated, and the modified value being tested again and divide that by 10. The result is the "degrees of success." 

### Example #1:
Zail is attempting to coerce imformation from a someone with out harming them. So they will attempt to charm them. The individual they wish to charme is romantically interested in Zail and is fairly nieve so the test itself has a +30 "difficulty value". Zail has a Charisma of 39 meaning that the test will be a success so long as the random number is 69 or lower. In this case, how much Zail succeds or fails by is relevent, as while a minor failure would result in their target simply not giving them the information they ask for, a major failure would result in the them leaving and avoiding Zail from then on, while a major success mean that while they will provide the informaiton Zail is asking about but that that they will volunteer more that they Zail didn't ask about.

The test results in a random number of 14. To determine the degree of success we take the 69 that was needed to pass, and subtract the 14 from that giving us 55. We then divid that by 10 and disgard anything after the decimal. In this case we get 5 degrees of success (55/10 = 5 degrees of success). 5 degrees of succes result in Zail's target giving up a substantial amount of additional information.
