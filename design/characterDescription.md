## Characters:
A character is a theoretical construct built out of a series of 9 integer values ranging from 0 to 99 that represent a characters proficiency in using a melee weapon (Weapon skill), shooting a weapon (Ballistic Skill), their overall physical strength (Strength), how resilient they are to damage (toughness), their agility, intelligence, how likely they are to see things in the world or during a fight, their will power and their fellowship or charisma.
 
These characteristics are used to determine whether a character passes or fails at various tasks. If a character needs to carry something, their Strength characteristic will be used to determine their ability to do so, while if they attempting to perform a sniper attack their ballistic skill would be used. 

A Rogue Trader will also include a list of skills that represent a character’s adeptness with a given skill. A given skill is tested on a specified characteristic (an effort at an acrobatic feat test on the agility, while awareness tests on the perception for instance). Skills come in 4 “levels”: basic, trained, skilled and mastered. A basic skill tests on the required characteristic as if it were ½ of its actual value. A trained skill tests on the actual value of the of the characteristic, a skilled skill tests on the characteristic as if it were 10% higher than its actual value while a mastered skill tests with a 20% bonus.  A Character can gain proficiency in each talent, advancing the talent from ‘basic’ to trained to skilled to mastered. 

As a character conducts actions they will acrue different ammounts of expierence. When they have acrued enough enough expierence they will 'level up', meaning that they will be able to enhance their characters capability through new skills, new talents, and enhancements to their core characteristics.

###example:
When Ziel started the Cargo Delivery job, they had 6,870 expierence. Upon completing the job they gained 250 expierence bringing them to 7,120 total expierence earned and to level 2. This status would enable the "Advancement" option on the sreen.
