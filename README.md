# Project overview
This project is an outgrowth of a Zork clone I helped build for class. Using a CLI system similar to Zork, this game will permit a player to take on the role of a "Rogue Trader", an intergalactic free trader in the midst of the 41st mellenium who is seeking their fortune and glory. 

# Current status
**Prelimary write up**

At this point the project is in conceptualization. While I have ideas in my head of what I want, I need to get those ideas written down so I can work with them and start actually designing the engine and systems to power this game.
